# Hi there!

My name is Lanfran and I'm the author of this blog. I made it to help you hack your way to learn!

We all know how hard is to start in capture the flag. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, know how things works and read, _A LOT_

This blog is pretty basic and covers some of the rooms in CTFs platforms. All you have to do is start hacking!
